内容

Suppose you are applying ML in a setting where the training and the dev/test distributions are different. Say, the training set contains Internet images + Mobile images, and the dev/test sets contain only Mobile images. However, the algorithm is not working well: It has a much higher dev/test set error than you would like. Here are some possibilities of what might be wrong:

假设您在训练和开发/测试分布不同的环境中应用ML。比如，训练集包含Internet图像+移动图像，dev / test集仅包含Mobile图像。但是，该算法运行不正常：它具有比您想要的更高的开发/测试集错误。以下是可能出错的一些可能性：

1. It does not do well on the training set. This is the problem of high (avoidable) bias on the training set distribution.

   它在训练集上表现不佳。这是训练集分布上的高（可避免）偏差的问题。

2. It does well on the training set, but does not generalize well to previously unseen data *drawn from the same distribution as the training set*. This is high variance.

   它在训练集上表现良好，但不能很好地概括从与训练集相同的分布中提取的先前未看到的数据。这是高度差异。

3. It generalizes well to new data drawn from the same distribution as the training set, but not to data drawn from the dev/test set distribution. We call this problem **data mismatch**, since it is because the training set data is a poor match for the dev/test set data.

   它很好地概括了从与训练集相同的分布中提取的新数据，但不是从开发/测试集分布中提取的数据。我们称此问题数据不匹配，因为这是因为训练集数据与开发/测试集数据不匹配。

For example, suppose that humans achieve near perfect performance on the cat recognition task. Your algorithm achieves this:

例如，假设人类在猫识别任务上获得接近完美的表现。您的算法实现了这一点：

- 1% error on the training set

  训练集上1％的错误

- 1.5% error on data drawn from the same distribution as the training set that the algorithm has not seen

  从与算法未见过的训练集相同的分布中提取的数据误差为1.5％

- 10% error on the dev set

  开发设置有10％的错误

In this case, you clearly have a data mismatch problem. To address this, you might try to make the training data more similar to the dev/test data. We discuss some techniques for this later.

在这种情况下，您显然存在数据不匹配问题。要解决此问题，您可以尝试使训练数据更类似于开发/测试数据。我们稍后会讨论一些技巧。

In order to diagnose to what extent an algorithm suffers from each of the problems 1-3 above, it will be useful to have another dataset. Specifically, rather than giving the algorithm all the available training data, you can split it into two subsets: The actual training set which the algorithm will train on, and a separate set, which we will call the “Training dev” set, that we will not train on.

为了诊断算法在多大程度上受到上述问题1-3的影响，具有另一个数据集将是有用的。具体来说，不是给算法提供所有可用的训练数据，你可以将它分成两个子集：算法将训练的实际训练集，以及一个单独的集合，我们称之为“训练开发”集，即我们不会训练。

You now have four subsets of data:

您现在有四个数据子集：

- Training set. This is the data that the algorithm will learn from (e.g., Internet images + Mobile images). This does not have to be drawn from the same distribution as what we really care about (the dev/test set distribution).

  训练集。这是算法将从中学习的数据（例如，因特网图像+移动图像）。这不必从我们真正关心的相同分布（开发/测试集分布）中得出。

- Training dev set: This data is drawn from the same distribution as the training set (e.g., Internet images + Mobile images). This is usually smaller than the training set; it only needs to be large enough to evaluate and track the progress of our learning algorithm.

  训练开发集：该数据来自与训练集相同的分布（例如，因特网图像+移动图像）。这通常小于训练集;它只需要足够大，以评估和跟踪我们的学习算法的进度。

- Dev set: This is drawn from the same distribution as the test set, and it reflects the distribution of data that we ultimately care about doing well on. (E.g., mobile images.)

  Dev set：这是从与测试集相同的分布中得出的，它反映了我们最终关心的数据分布。 （例如，移动图像。）

- Test set: This is drawn from the same distribution as the dev set. (E.g., mobile images.) 

  测试集：这是从与开发集相同的分布中绘制的。 （例如，移动图像。）

Armed with these four separate datasets, you can now evaluate:

有了这四个独立的数据集，您现在可以评估：

- Training error, by evaluating on the training set.

  通过评估训练集来训练错误。

- The algorithm’s ability to generalize to new data drawn from the training set distribution, by evaluating on the training dev set.

  通过评估训练开发集，算法能够推广从训练集分布中提取的新数据。

- The algorithm’s performance on the task you care about, by evaluating on the dev and/or test sets.

  通过评估开发和/或测试集，算法在您关心的任务上的表现.

Most of the guidelines in Chapters 5-7 for picking the size of the dev set also apply to the training dev set.

第5-7章中用于选择开发集大小的大多数指南也适用于训练开发集。
