You want to build a new email anti-spam system. Your team has several ideas:

您想构建一个新的电子邮件反垃圾邮件系统。您的团队有几个想法：

- Collect a huge training set of spam email. For example, set up a “honeypot”: deliberately send fake email addresses to known spammers, so that you can automatically harvest the spam messages they send to those addresses.

  收集大量垃圾邮件培训。例如，设置“蜜罐”：故意向已知的垃圾邮件发送者发送虚假的电子邮件地址，以便您可以自动收集他们发送到这些地址的垃圾邮件。

- Develop features for understanding the text content of the email.

  开发用于理解电子邮件文本内容的功能。

- Develop features for understanding the email envelope/header features to show what set of internet servers the message went through.

  开发功能以了解电子邮件信封/标题功能，以显示消息所经历的互联网服务器集。

- and more.

  和更多。

Even though I have worked extensively on anti-spam, I would still have a hard time picking one of these directions. It is even harder if you are not an expert in the application area.

虽然我已经广泛研究过反垃圾邮件，但我仍然很难选择其中一个方向。如果您不是应用领域的专家，那就更难了。

So don’t start off trying to design and build the perfect system. Instead, build and train a basic system quickly—perhaps in just a few days.5 Even if the basic system is far from the “best” system you can build, it is valuable to examine how the basic system functions: you will quickly find clues that show you the most promising directions in which to invest your time. These next few chapters will show you how to read these clues.

因此，不要试图设计和构建完美的系统。相反，可以在短短几天内快速构建和培训基本系统.5即使基本系统远离您可以构建的“最佳”系统，检查基本系统如何运行也很有价值：您将很快发现这些线索向您展示了投资时间的最有前途的方向。接下来的几章将向您展示如何阅读这些线索。

5 This advice is meant for readers wanting to build AI applications, rather than those whose goal is to publish academic papers. I will later return to the topic of doing research.

5这个建议适用于想要构建AI应用程序的读者，而不是那些目标是发表学术论文的读者。我稍后会回到做研究的主题。
