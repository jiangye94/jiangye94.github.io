Suppose you have developed a speech recognition system that does very well on the training set and on the training dev set. However, it does poorly on your dev set: You have a data mismatch problem. What can you do?

假设您已经开发了一个语音识别系统，该系统在训练集和训练开发集上表现很好。但是，它在您的开发集上表现不佳：您遇到数据不匹配问题。你能做什么？

I recommend that you: (i) Try to understand what properties of the data differ between the training and the dev set distributions. (ii) Try to find more training data that better matches the dev set examples that your algorithm has trouble with.^14^

我建议你：（i）尝试理解训练和开发集分布之间数据的哪些属性不同。 （ii）尝试找到更多匹配您的算法遇到问题的开发示例的训练数据

For example, suppose you carry out an error analysis on the speech recognition dev set: You manually go through 100 examples, and try to understand where the algorithm is making mistakes. You find that your system does poorly because most of the audio clips in the dev set are taken within a car, whereas most of the training examples were recorded against a quiet background. The engine and road noise dramatically worsen the performance of your speech system. In this case, you might try to acquire more training data comprising audio clips that were taken in a car. The purpose of the error analysis is to understand the significant differences between the training and the dev set, which is what leads to the data mismatch.

例如，假设您对语音识别开发集进行了错误分析：您手动完成100个示例，并尝试了解算法出错的位置。您发现您的系统运行不佳，因为开发套件中的大多数音频剪辑都是在汽车内拍摄的，而大多数训练示例是在安静的背景下拍摄的。发动机和道路噪音会严重恶化您的语音系统的性能。在这种情况下，您可能会尝试获取更多包含在汽车中拍摄的音频剪辑的训练数据。错误分析的目的是了解训练和开发集之间的显着差异，这是导致数据不匹配的原因。

If your training and training dev sets include audio recorded within a car, you should also double-check your system’s performance on this subset of data. If it is doing well on the car data in the training set but not on car data in the training dev set, then this further validates the hypothesis that getting more car data would help. This is why we discussed the possibility of including in your training set some data drawn from the same distribution as your dev/test set in the previous chapter. Doing so allows you to compare your performance on the car data in the training set vs. the dev/test set.

如果您的培训和培训开发人员设置包含汽车内录制的音频，您还应该仔细检查系统在此数据子集上的表现。如果它在训练集中的汽车数据上表现良好，而在训练开发集中的汽车数据上表现不佳，那么这进一步验证了获得更多汽车数据将有所帮助的假设。这就是为什么我们讨论了在训练集中包含一些数据的可能性，这些数据来自与前一章中的开发/测试集相同的分布。这样做可以让您比较训练集中汽车数据与开发/测试集的性能。

Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in this process. For example, if you don't have any way to get more training data that better match the dev set data, you might not have a clear path towards improving performance.

不幸的是，在这个过程中没有任何保证。例如，如果您没有任何方法可以获得更多与开发集数据更匹配的训练数据，那么您可能没有明确的方法来提高性能。

14 There is also some research on “domain adaptation”—how to train an algorithm on one distribution and have it generalize to a different distribution. These methods are typically applicable only in special types of problems and are much less widely used than the ideas described in this chapter.

14还有一些关于“领域适应”的研究 - 如何在一个分布上训练算法并将其推广到不同的分布。这些方法通常仅适用于特殊类型的问题，并且与本章中描述的思想相比，使用的方法要少得多。
