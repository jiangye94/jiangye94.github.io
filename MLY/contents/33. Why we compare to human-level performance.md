Many machine learning systems aim to automate things that humans do well. Examples include image recognition, speech recognition, and email spam classification. Learning algorithms have also improved so much that we are now surpassing human-level performance on more and more of these tasks.

许多机器学习系统旨在自动化人类做得好的事情。示例包括图像识别，语音识别和电子邮件垃圾邮件分类。学习算法也得到了很大的改进，现在我们在越来越多的这些任务中超越了人类的表现。

Further, there are several reasons building an ML system is easier if you are trying to do a task that people can do well:

此外，如果您正在尝试执行人们可以做得很好的任务，那么建立ML系统有几个原因：

**1.**  **Ease of obtaining data from human labelers.** For example, since people recognize cat images well, it is straightforward for people to provide high accuracy labels for your learning algorithm.

1.易于从人类贴标机获取数据。例如，由于人们很好地识别猫图像，因此人们可以直接为您的学习算法提供高精度标签。

**2.**  **Error analysis can draw on human intuition.** Suppose a speech recognition algorithm is doing worse than human-level recognition. Say it incorrectly transcribes an audio clip as “This recipe calls for a *pear* of apples,” mistaking “pair” for “pear.” You can draw on human intuition and try to understand what information a person uses to get the correct transcription, and use this knowledge to modify the learning algorithm.

误差分析可以借鉴人的直觉。假设语音识别算法比人类识别算法差。说它错误地将音频剪辑转录为“此食谱需要苹果梨”，将“配对”误认为是“梨”。您可以利用人类的直觉并尝试了解一个人用来获取正确转录的信息，以及使用这些知识来修改学习算法。

**3.**  **Use human-level performance to estimate the optimal error rate and also set a “desired error rate.”** Suppose your algorithm achieves 10% error on a task, but a person achieves 2% error. Then we know that the optimal error rate is 2% or lower and the avoidable bias is at least 8%. Thus, you should try bias-reducing techniques.

3.使用人类级别的性能来估计最佳错误率并设置“所需的错误率”。假设您的算法在任务上达到10％的错误，但是一个人犯了2％的错误。然后我们知道最佳错误率为2％或更低，可避免偏差至少为8％。因此，您应该尝试降低偏差的技术。

Even though item #3 might not sound important, I find that having a reasonable and achievable target error rate helps accelerate a team’s progress. Knowing your algorithm has high avoidable bias is incredibly valuable and opens up a menu of options to try.

尽管第3项可能听起来不重要，但我发现具有合理且可实现的目标错误率有助于加快团队的进度。知道你的算法有很高的可避免偏差是非常有价值的，并打开了一个选项来尝试。

There are some tasks that even humans aren’t good at. For example, picking a book to recommend to you; or picking an ad to show a user on a website; or predicting the stock market. Computers already surpass the performance of most people on these tasks. With these applications, we run into the following problems:

有些任务甚至连人类都不擅长。例如，挑选一本书给你推荐;或选择广告以在网站上显示用户;或预测股市。计算机已经超过了大多数人在这些任务上的表现。有了这些应用程序，我们遇到了以下问题：

- **It is harder to obtain labels.** For example, it’s hard for human labelers to annotate a database of users with the “optimal” book recommendation. If you operate a website or app that sells books, you can obtain data by showing books to users and seeing what they buy. If you do not operate such a site, you need to find more creative ways to get data.

  获取标签更难。例如，人类贴标机很难用“最佳”书籍推荐来注释用户数据库。如果您经营销售图书的网站或应用，您可以通过向用户展示图书并查看他们购买的商品来获取数据。如果您不运营此类网站，则需要找到更有创意的方法来获取数据。

- **Human intuition is harder to count on.** For example, pretty much no one can predict the stock market. So if our stock prediction algorithm does no better than random guessing, it is hard to figure out how to improve it.

  人类的直觉更难以依靠。例如，几乎没有人可以预测股市。因此，如果我们的股票预测算法并不比随机猜测更好，那么很难弄清楚如何改进它。

- **It is hard to know what the optimal error rate and reasonable desired error rate is.** Suppose you already have a book recommendation system that is doing quite well. How do you know how much more it can improve without a human baseline?

  很难知道最佳错误率和合理的期望错误率是多少。假设您已经有一个表现良好的图书推荐系统。你怎么知道没有人类基线可以提高多少？
