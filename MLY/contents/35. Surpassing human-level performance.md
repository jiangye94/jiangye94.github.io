内容

You are working on speech recognition and have a dataset of audio clips. Suppose your dataset has many noisy audio clips so that even humans have 10% error. Suppose your system already achieves 8% error. Can you use any of the three techniques described in Chapter 33 to continue making rapid progress?

您正在处理语音识别并拥有音频剪辑的数据集。假设您的数据集有许多嘈杂的音频剪辑，即使是人类也有10％的错误。假设您的系统已经达到8％的误差。您能否使用第33章中描述的三种技术中的任何一种继续快速进步？

If you can identify a subset of data in which humans significantly surpass your system, then you can still use those techniques to drive rapid progress. For example, suppose your system is much better than people at recognizing speech in noisy audio, but humans are still better at transcribing very rapidly spoken speech.

如果您能够识别人类显着优于您的系统的数据子集，那么您仍然可以使用这些技术来推动快速进步。例如，假设您的系统比在嘈杂的音频中识别语音的人要好得多，但人类仍然能够更快速地转录语音。

For the subset of data with rapidly spoken speech:

对于具有快速语音的数据子集：

1. You can still obtain transcripts from humans that are higher quality than your algorithm’s output.

   您仍然可以从人类获得质量高于算法输出的成绩单。

2. You can draw on human intuition to understand why they correctly heard a rapidly spoken utterance when your system didn’t.

   你可以利用人类的直觉来理解为什么当你的系统没有时，他们正确地听到了快速说出的话语。

3. You can use human-level performance on rapidly spoken speech as a desired performance target.

   您可以将快速语音的人类表现用作期望的表现目标。

More generally, so long as there are dev set examples where humans are right and your algorithm is wrong, then many of the techniques described earlier will apply. This is true even if, averaged over the entire dev/test set, your performance is already surpassing human-level performance.

更一般地说，只要存在设置人类正确并且算法错误的示例，那么前面描述的许多技术都将适用。即使在整个开发/测试集上平均，您的性能已经超过人类级别的性能，也是如此。

There are many important machine learning applications where machines surpass human level performance. For example, machines are better at predicting movie ratings, how long it takes for a delivery car to drive somewhere, or whether to approve loan applications. Only a subset of techniques apply once humans have a hard time identifying examples that the algorithm is clearly getting wrong. Consequently, progress is usually slower on problems where machines already surpass human-level performance, while progress is faster when machines are still trying to catch up to humans.

有许多重要的机器学习应用程序，其中机器超过人类的性能。例如，机器可以更好地预测电影评级，送货车在某个地方开车需要多长时间，或者是否批准贷款申请。一旦人类很难确定算法明显出错的例子，只有一部分技术适用。因此，在机器已经超过人类水平的性能的问题上进展通常较慢，而当机器仍然试图赶上人类时进展更快。
